## Printers & Printing Technology

### What is a thermal printer?
A thermal printer is a printer that uses heat to generate a printout. There are two types of thermal printers: direct thermal and thermal-transfer. Direct thermal printers apply heat directly to labels coated with a dye, generating a printout, whereas thermal-transfer printers apply heat to a ribbon, which then transfers ink to the label.

### What is Direct Thermal?
Direct thermal printing uses heat to selectively activate chemically treated, thermosensitive labels. The printer's heated print-head comes in direct contact with the label, that has been coated with a material (a leuco dye) specially formulated to change color when exposed to heat. Once heated, the thermosensitive label reacts and darkens, creating the desired print.

As such, direct thermal printers use no ink, toner, or ribbon.

**Important Note**  
One important consideration when choosing this method is that the print is unstable and prone to fading over time, especially when stored in hot or humid conditions. Scratches can also produce enough heat to create marks on the label and affect the quality of the print.

### What is Thermal-Transfer?
Thermal-transfer printing uses a ribbon to print information on labels. The heated print-head is used to melt the ink coating of the ribbon, transferring it to the label. Since the label itself is not reactive, the print produced by this method is much more stable and a lot more durable. The ribbon is typically composed of either resin or wax, or a combination of the two.

Thermal-transfer labels are usually made from a thermoplastic film, but can be made of paper material as well.

Thermal-transfer printing is the most widely used printing process in the world for printing of high-quality barcodes.

### What is the difference between direct thermal and thermal-transfer?
Direct thermal and thermal-transfer printing both use a heated print-head to print on blank labels. However, with direct thermal printers, the print-head must be in direct contact with the label material, while thermal-transfer printers use an ink ribbon to print, made of wax or resin, and this is what comes into contact with the heated print-head.

As such, direct thermal applies heat directly to the label, which reacts with the label's coating to generate a printout, whereas thermal-transfer printers apply heat to the ribbon, allowing the ink to then be transferred to the label.

### How to Calibrate Your Printer
Printer calibration is a simple but important process that ensures your printed labels line-up correctly on the paper, reducing waste and lost time.

**Here's how to calibrate the different printer models we currently provide:**

**Cab**  
Calibrate the printer by pressing and holding the button located on the back right of the printer until the LED lights flash red; then release the button and the printer will now calibrate.

After going through the calibration process, you can press the feed button to make sure it is correctly calibrated as the printer should feed only one label at a time.

**Zebra**  
With the printer powered up, hold down the feed button until you get a two-flash sequence (the light will flash once, the twice) from the status light, then release the feed button.

You can then press the feed button to ensure only one label at a time comes out, indicating the printer is correctly calibrated.

**Cognitive**  
In the administrator's label positioning tab, under "index settings", select the appropriate indexing method for your labels. Click apply, save, and then calibrate to perform the calibration. You should receive a "successful" status message.

If calibration was successful, pressing the Feed button will eject only one label at a time.

### Left-Aligned vs. Center-Aligned Printers
**Left-aligned** printers is the standard printing mechanism. Here, the printhead pressure plungers need to be adjusted according to label width.

**Center-aligned** printers provide a uniform printhead pressure for all label widths, so there is no need to adjust the pressure plungers. Here, the media guide and roller are aligned to increase print accuracy, with minimal to zero shifting. They are ideal for very narrow (less than 1") labels.

### Printing Labels in Color
For printing color labels, especially when multiple colors are required, inkjet printers offer the most complete solution. This is primarily due to the image quality provided. By allowing extremely precise placing of ink dots, these printers can more accurately reproduce an image, with very bright and vivid colors. This produces high-quality images and graphics.

Inkjet printers are also the only printers that can support either sheets or rolls.

Desktop inkjet printers, like those sold by HP, print labels in sheet format, while inkjet roll printers, such as those offered by Primera, can print labels in roll format. Both printer types provide similar quality results, though rolls printers can help reduce costs, by allowing for on-demand printing and the ability to load individual ink cartridges.

### Core Size
Core size applies to labels that come in roll format. The core size refers to the diameter of the plastic or cardboard tube on which your labels are rolled.

The inside diameter (I.D.) will determine if the label roll will fit on the label spindle, and as such is compatible with your printer. The outside diameter (O.D.) is less important, as it plays a role in determining the length of the roll (i.e. number of labels the roll can hold).

Most desktop thermal printers are designed to work with 1" (25 mm) cores, with the bigger, more industrial models set-up to work with 3" (76 mm) cores. 2" (51 mm) cores are less frequently used, but typically roll printers for inkjet labels will use this size.

## Labels & Applications

### Cryogenic Labels
Cryogenic labels are designed to withstand the extreme temperatures of cryopreservation. They are perfect for long-term storage of containers in liquid and vapor phase liquid nitrogen (-196°C/-321°F), laboratory freezers (-40°C/-40°F, -80°C/-112°F, -120°C/-184°F), and transportation on dry ice.

Many types of cryo labels are available, depending on the desired use and application surface. This includes cryo labels specially designed for:
- Tubes, vials, and boxes
- Tube and vial caps
- Frozen surfaces
- Microplates
- IVF straws
- PCR tubes
- Metal racks
- Cryo storage canes

These labels are compatible with several types of printers:
- Thermal-transfer
- Direct thermal
- Inkjet
- Laser
- DYMO
- Automated printers

Provided with either a permanent or removable adhesive, in white, transparent or assorted colors, the labels are available as tamper-evident, destructible, blackout, piggyback, or wrap-around labels.

### Autoclave Labels
Autoclave labels are thermoplastic labels that resist the extreme heat and pressure of autoclaving, intended for materials that will undergo the sterilization process. These autoclave-resistant labels are ideal for labeling metal, glass, and plastic surfaces, and will withstand sterilization in steam autoclaves, dry heat ovens, gamma irradiators, and ethylene oxide gas chambers.

They have a working temperature range of -60°C/-76°F to +150°C/+302°F, resisting up to 30 psi of pressure as well as radiation levels as high as 50 KGy.

These labels are compatible with several types of printing methods:
- Thermal-transfer
- Inkjet
- Laser

Available in a range of formats, including permanent or removable, as well as blackout, piggyback, and wrap-around.

### Direct Thermal labels vs Chemicals and Heat
Direct thermal labels are not appropriate for any applications where the labels may be exposed to harsh chemicals, intense heat or prolonged exposure to light.

Direct thermal printing uses thermosensitive labels, that are coated with a special dye that can switch between two chemicals forms when exposed to heat, light or pH.

Specifically, direct thermal printers use a heated print-head to directly heat the thermosensitive labels, which react to the heat and darken, creating the desired print.

Because of this, direct thermal labels are not suitable for certain applications. This can include sterilization protocols that require high temperatures, such as steam autoclaves and dry heat ovens.

The coating also reacts with various classes of chemicals, including acids, clearing agents (e.g. xylene) and alcohols. Moreover, direct thermal labels are also fairly light sensitive, and will completely darken if exposed to UV light.

### Finding the Right CryoSTUCK Labels for your Tubes
Careful consideration must be given when choosing the right CryoSTUCK® label for your cryogenic storage tubes. There are 2 main criteria that must be addressed:
- Firstly, the CryoSTUCK label must be chosen so as to create an area of overlap when the label is wrapped onto the frozen tube of at least 0.25". This ensures the best possible adhesion when the label is applied onto frozen vials.
- Secondly, a label must be chosen so that the printable portion (the portion of the label which excludes the clear wrap-around portion) is small enough as to not overlap with the rest of the label when applied onto the tube.

See our [CryoSTUCK Size Guide](../Guides/cryostuck-size-guide.md) for detailed sizing recommendations for specific tube types.

### Label Size Table
The maximum dimensions to avoid overlap are indicated below for each tube/vial size.

| Vial/Tube Size | Width | Height |
|----------------|-------|--------|
| 0.2 ml (PCR) | 19 mm / 0.75″ | 7 mm / 0.28″ |
| 0.5 ml (Eppendorf™) | 22 mm / 0.87″ | 15 mm / 0.59″ |
| 1.0 ml (Matrix™/Biotube™) | 25 mm / 1.00" | 32mm / 1.26" |
| 1 ml (skirted) | 29 mm / 1.14″ | 19 mm / 0.75″ |
| 1.5 ml (Eppendorf™) | 29 mm / 1.14″ | 18 mm / 0.71″ |
| 1.8 – 2 ml (skirted) | 32 mm / 1.26″ | 28 mm / 1.10″ |
| 5 ml (conical tube) | 32 mm / 1.26″ | 67 mm / 2.64″ |
| 15 ml (conical tube) | 44 mm / 1.73″ | 85 mm / 3.35″ |
| 50 ml (conical tube) | 82 mm / 3.23″ | 86 mm / 3.39″ |
| 13 x 75 (blood collection vial) | 40 mm / 1.57″ | 50 mm / 2.00″ |
| 13 x 100 (blood collection vial) | 40 mm / 1.57″ | 75 mm / 2.95″ |
| 16 x 100 (blood collection vial) | 50 mm / 2.00″ | 75 mm / 2.95″ |
| 16 x 125 (blood collection vial) | 50 mm / 2.00″ | 100 mm / 4.00″ |

Note that these sizes are approximate and may vary depending on the exact brand of vial/tube that you are using.

### How to Correctly Apply CryoSTUCK® Labels
CryoSTUCK labels can be applied at -80°C, ideally done on dry ice. Preserving the integrity of biological samples is vital, especially when labeling multiple vials. You don't want to open and close your tank or freezer too many times or let your samples thaw on the bench. We recommend you do your labeling in batches and always set your samples in an insulated container of dry ice to preserve the temperature at -80°C. This is recommended as CryoSTUCK labels are meant to be applied at a minimum temperature of -80°C. Allow your tubes to equilibrate on dry ice for at least 5 minutes before labeling.

For detailed application instructions for different label types, see our [CryoSTUCK Application Guide](../Guides/cryostuck-application.md).

### What is the Difference between Thermal-Transfer and Direct Thermal Printing
While both methods employ a heated printer head, thermal-transfer printers require an ink ribbon, while direct thermal printers do not need any ink sources for printing.

Direct-thermal and thermal-transfer printing share many similarities. Both techniques use a heated print head to print on the blank label. The main difference between the two techniques is the use of a printing ribbon in thermal-transfer printing, which is not required with direct-thermal methods.

Direct thermal printing uses heat to activate thermosensitive paper labels. The heated print head comes in direct contact with the label. When heated, the thermosensitive label reacts and darkens, creating the desired print. One important consideration when choosing this method is that this print is unstable and prone to fading over time, especially when stored in hot or humid conditions. Scratches can also produce enough heat to create marks on the label and affect the quality of the print.

In contrast to direct thermal printing, thermal-transfer methods use a ribbon to print information on labels. The heated print head is used to melt the ink coating of the ribbon, transferring it to the label. Since the label itself is not reactive, the print produced by this method is much more stable and a lot more durable. Thermal-transfer labels are usually made from a thermoplastic film, but can be made of paper material as well.

### LIMS
What exactly constitutes a laboratory management system is continually evolving, with new features and functionality added regularly; however, the base set of functions that define the LIMS software include:
- Reception and logging of a sample with its associated data
- Assignment, tracking, and scheduling of the sample's analytical workload
- Quality control associated with the sample and any utilized equipment and inventory
- Storage of data acquired from any performed analyses
- Compilation, inspection, and approval of data for reporting and further analysis

Barcode labels are an indispensable part of a functional LIMS system. Without the use of barcodes, it would be impossible to properly track samples or to automate analytical workflows, as you would need to manually enter information at every step of the analysis. However, barcode labels serve a purpose beyond their ability to label your samples with scannable barcodes.

In addition to the use of barcodes, you should also consider factors that might affect the quality of your labels, including loss of adhesion, smudging, or fading, all of which can result in the loss of information associated with the sample. As such, it is critical that you use the appropriate labels for your application. Luckily, a wide range of specialty labels exists that can match any laboratory storage and/or usage condition, making it possible to achieve a 100% accurate sample identification and associated data traceability.

Regardless of your lab's specific needs, there is a smart labeling solution available to meet your demanding standards. Ideal for all SOPs in biomedical and clinical research, from blood work and molecular biology to diagnostics and the identification of medication in clinical trials. They can also be made compatible with various printing methods commonly used in all laboratories and research facilities, such as thermal transfer, direct thermal, laser, and inkjet, or even automated print-and-apply systems.

To adjust the speed, uncheck 'Use current printer settings' in the 'Speed Settings' field. Then reduce the printing speed (lowest value will depend on the driver/printer you are using).

## Implementation & Troubleshooting

### How to match a ribbon to your labels
Careful consideration must be given when choosing a thermal-transfer ribbon. There are 4 main criteria that must be addressed:

- The ribbon must be carefully matched with the material of the label being printed. For example, NitroTAG™ labels must be printed with RR class ribbons in order to ensure printout quality and optimal performance under cryogenic conditions.

- Ribbons are available in either 0.5" or 1" diameter cores, which are the cardboard cylinders that hold the ribbon. It is best to consult the user manual of your thermal printer to ensure the right core diameter is used.

- Choose a ribbon that is within the maximum width parameter of your printer (see your printer's user manual), but still covers the entire width of your label to ensure that the printout encompasses the complete printable area of your label. It is fine to use a ribbon that is wider than your label width, though this can result in excessive ribbon waste. However, this may be advantageous in certain circumstances when different labels sizes are printed, as this will avoid unwanted swapping of ribbons.

- Lastly, certain ribbon types are available in various lengths. Though, these varied ribbon lengths may be supplied on rolls that are too thick to fit into some of the smaller desktop thermal printers. Again, check your printer's user manual for the right size recommendation.

Luckily at LABTAG, we have made your choice easier by offering quick and easy recommendations once you have chosen your desired label on our website. From there, use the handy filtering options to choose your ribbon according to your thermal printer type.

Our ribbon recommendations are the result of extensive research and development with careful consideration given to the performance of the label and ribbon as a whole.

### Where Can I Download Label Templates in Word Format for Printing Laser & Inkjet Labels?
LabTAG offers free MS Word templates for your laser and inkjet printers under the templates tab. We provide free Word label templates in both Letter Sheet Format (8.5" x 11") and A4 European Sheet Format (210 mm x 297 mm) for easy formatting and printing of all our laser and inkjet labels. You can download them for free from our [Templates page](https://www.labtag.com/resources/templates/).

To find your template, go to the Templates page and choose your format. If your product number starts with A4, then choose the A4 format. If not, then choose Letter US. Then locate the numeric portion of your label's product number. This corresponds to the template you are looking for.

For example, the template that corresponds to the product number CL-12 is template #12 in the Letter section of the Templates page.

### The printing on my Laser Labels is too Close/Exceeds the Label Margins.

- Once your template is open in Word, click on the "Page Layout" or "Layout" tab.
- Click the "Margins" button.
- At the bottom of the drop-down window, select "Custom Margins".
- In the new "Page Setup" window (under the "Margins" tab), make sure the correct margins (Top and Sides) are entered as indicated on our "GA International labels for laser printers formatting appendix" located [here](https://cdn.labtag.com/wp-content/uploads/GA-International-Appendix-EN012020-January-28-2020.pdf).
- If Word shows a warning pop-up indicating that some margins might be outside of the "printable area of the page", click "Ignore".
- Please keep in mind that the number of the template is equivalent to the product's SKU# (i.e. #23 is the corresponding template for CL, RCL, and TRCL-23).

### Can I print a few Labels and Save the label Sheet for Future Printing?
Yes. We design our labels for convenience and conservation. We understand that you might want to print only a few and save the remaining labels for later use. Our laser label sheets can withstand multiple passes in a laser printer without the labels peeling off or jamming the printer.

### I Want to Print My Labels from the Paper Tray but Receive an Error Message to Load Paper Into the Manual Feed.
- In Word 2007, select the "Page Layout" tab and click the "Expand" icon in the "Page Setup" box.
- Select the "Paper" tab in the new window and set the "Paper Source" for the first and subsequent pages to "Default Tray (Auto Select)".

### The Ink Does Not Adhere to the Labels and Comes off When I Remove the Labels from the Sheet.
Verify your printer settings, and ensure your using the correct media type. The ink is not fused with enough heat to your labels. Please verify your settings as follows:

- Press the Print button, then click "Properties" next to your printer's name.
- Verify the Media/Paper Type. Most likely, it will be set to "Plain Paper". Click the drop-down box and select "Label" as Media Type. If your printer does not offer "label" as an option, select "Thicker Paper".

### The printout on My Thermal-Transfer labels is Faint and Barely legible.
To address issues with faint printing, increase the darkness setting on your printer. You can also reduce print speed to further resolve the problem.

There is likely not enough heat applied to the ribbon to efficiently transfer the ink to the label, especially if you are using a resin ribbon.

The settings can be easily adjusted if you use the BarTender label printing software. Press the Print button and select "Document Properties" underneath your printer's name.

Verify that the current settings in the "Stock" tab are correct. Your print method should display "Thermal-Transfer" and the Media Type should reflect your label type.

Select the "Options" tab and uncheck "Use current printer settings" in the "Darkness" field. With "Relative" selected, move the bar to the right to about 20 and confirm by clicking OK. This should increase the darkness of your printout. Please increase the darkness further if the problem persists.

If the printout is still not as expected, even with the darkness set to maximum, uncheck "Use current printer settings" in the "Speed Settings" field. Then reduce the printing speed to 3.00 in/sec or 2.00 in/sec.

### Why Do My Labels Have a Black Mark in the Back or a Notch Between Two Labels
These are sensors used by the printer to identify the correct placement of the label, for accurate printing.

In order for labels to properly feed through the printer in the correct alignment, the printer has to be able to identify where each label starts and ends. To do so, the printer uses sensors to detect black marks or notches between labels. This allows the printer to position labels properly and to produce a well-aligned printout. In order for the sensors to detect the black marks or notches, please make sure that you select the correct Media Type as described below.

If you use BarTender, please press Print and click "Document Properties" underneath your printer's name. Select the "Stock" tab and make sure that "Non-Continuous (Mark Sensing)" is set as Media Type.

### Can I Import Data from My Database into BarTender and Print the Information on My Labels
Yes. This requires at least the Professional version of the BarTender software. In order to import your data, you will have to create a text field or barcode first. Next, double-click the text box/barcode and click the icon to the right of the box which reads "Embedded Data". Select "Database Field" from the dropdown menu and click "Next".

Click the "Database Connection Setup" button and follow the Wizard. Please do not hesitate to contact us at your convenience if you have questions concerning the setup of your database or problems connecting your database to BarTender.

## Cryogenic Labeling

### How cold can cryogenic labels get?
Our standard cryogenic labels can withstand temperatures as low as -196°C (liquid nitrogen) and as high as +110°C, making them suitable for all laboratory freezing applications, including liquid nitrogen storage, ultra-low temperature freezers, and standard lab freezers.

### How long will cryogenic labels last in liquid nitrogen?
Our cryogenic labels have been tested to remain adhered and legible for 10+ years in liquid nitrogen storage, maintaining both physical attachment and barcode readability throughout this period. Long-term studies are ongoing.

### Can I apply labels to already-frozen containers?
Yes! Our CryoSTUCK® labels are specifically designed to be applied to containers at temperatures as low as -80°C without the need to thaw samples. This technology preserves sample integrity while allowing relabeling of frozen specimens. See our [CryoSTUCK® Application Guide](../Guides/cryostuck-application.md) for details.

### Will cryogenic labels withstand freeze-thaw cycles?
Yes, our cryogenic labels are designed to withstand multiple freeze-thaw cycles without compromising adhesion or print legibility. This makes them ideal for samples that are regularly retrieved and returned to storage.

### Can I print barcodes that will remain scannable after liquid nitrogen exposure?
Yes. Thermal transfer printing with RR-class resin ribbons provides the most durable results for cryogenic applications. Properly printed barcodes will maintain 100% readability even after extended storage in liquid nitrogen and multiple freeze-thaw cycles.

### Do I need different labels for different container types?
While we offer specialized formats optimized for specific containers (vials, tubes, plates, metal racks, etc.), many of our cryogenic label materials work well across multiple container types. The key factors are the label size, shape, and the container surface material rather than the label composition itself.

### What's the difference between cryogenic and deep-freeze labels?
Cryogenic labels are designed for the most extreme temperatures (-196°C) and are suitable for liquid nitrogen storage. Deep-freeze labels are designed primarily for ultra-low temperature freezers (-80°C) and may not perform as well in liquid nitrogen. All our cryogenic labels can be used in deep-freeze applications, but not all deep-freeze labels are suitable for cryogenic use.

## Printing & Materials

### What printing method provides the most durable results for cryogenic storage?
Thermal transfer printing with resin ribbons (RR-class) provides the most durable printing for cryogenic applications, with excellent resistance to extreme temperatures, chemicals, and mechanical abrasion.

### Can I use standard office printers for cryogenic labels?
We offer cryogenic labels compatible with standard office laser and inkjet printers, as well as DYMO desktop printers. While these provide good results, thermal transfer printing remains the gold standard for maximum durability in cryogenic environments.

### What's the difference between thermal transfer and direct thermal printing?
- **Thermal Transfer:** Uses a ribbon to transfer ink onto the label material. Provides the most durable results for cryogenic applications.
- **Direct Thermal:** The label material itself changes color when heated. More economical but less durable in extreme conditions and may fade over time.

### How should I store unused cryogenic labels?
Store unused labels in a cool, dry environment (20-25°C, 40-60% humidity) in their original packaging. Avoid exposure to direct sunlight, high heat, or humidity. Typical shelf life is 2 years from the production date.

### Are your cryogenic labels compatible with my printer?
Our cryogenic labels are available for all common printing technologies. For thermal transfer printing, we recommend checking our [Printer Compatibility Guide](./printer-compatibility.md) or contacting our support team for specific printer models.

## Application Techniques

### How should I clean containers before applying cryogenic labels?
Clean surfaces with isopropyl alcohol (70-100%) and allow to dry completely before applying labels. This removes oils, dust, and residues that could interfere with adhesion.

### How long should I wait before freezing newly labeled containers?
When possible, allow 24 hours for the adhesive to fully cure before exposing to extreme cold temperatures. This ensures optimal adhesion and performance. For CryoSTUCK® labels applied to already-frozen containers, no waiting period is necessary.

### What's the best orientation for barcodes on cryogenic vials?
For small vials, print barcodes in "ladder" orientation (running along the length of the vial) rather than "picket fence" orientation (wrapped around the circumference). This improves scanning reliability by preventing distortion from the curved surface.

### Should I use wrap-around labels for small vials?
Wrap-around labels with a clear protective overlay are recommended for small vials that will experience multiple freeze-thaw cycles or potential exposure to solvents. The clear tail protects the printed information and provides additional security.

### How do I avoid bubbles when applying cryogenic labels?
Apply labels from one edge and smooth toward the opposite edge using firm, even pressure. For small vials, use a label applicator tool or roll the vial across a flat surface while applying the label.

## Troubleshooting

### Why are my labels coming off in the freezer?
Common causes include:
- Insufficient surface cleaning before application
- Not allowing enough cure time before freezing
- Using the wrong label type for your storage conditions
- Contamination from oils or frost on the container
- Incompatible container surface material

### Why is the print fading or disappearing on my cryogenic labels?
For thermal transfer printing, this usually indicates you're using the wrong ribbon type (wax instead of resin) or insufficient print density. For other printing methods, it may indicate incompatible inks or inadequate protection from environmental conditions.

### Why won't my barcodes scan after freezing?
Common causes include:
- Print quality issues (too light, poor contrast)
- Frost or condensation on the label surface
- Barcode distortion from curved surfaces
- Wrong barcode orientation for container shape
- Label material or printing method not suited for cryogenic conditions

### How can I fix labels that have started to peel?
If a cryogenic label begins to peel, you can try:
1. For room temperature containers: Clean the area and apply a new label
2. For frozen containers: Apply a CryoSTUCK® label over the peeling label
3. For critical samples: Use a clear cryogenic overlaminate to secure the existing label

### What if my labels arrive damaged or don't perform as expected?

## RFID & Advanced Technologies

### Do RFID tags work in liquid nitrogen?
Yes, our cryogenic RFID labels are specifically engineered to function reliably at temperatures as low as -196°C. The embedded RFID chips and antennas remain functional even when fully immersed in liquid nitrogen.

### What are the advantages of RFID for cryogenic storage?
RFID technology allows:
- Reading without direct line-of-sight
- Bulk reading of multiple samples simultaneously
- Reading through frost or container walls
- Automated inventory management
- Reduced handling of samples during audits

### What's the difference between SimPEEL™ and SnapPEEL™ technologies?
- **SimPEEL™** provides an adhesive-free tab that makes peeling labels from the liner easier without the label sticking to gloves
- **SnapPEEL™** uses a connected circle-and-rectangle design that allows both labels to be peeled together, with the rectangular portion easily snapped off for application to the side of small vials

### Can automated labeling systems work with cryogenic labels?
Yes, we offer cryogenic labels specifically designed for automated print-and-apply systems. These labels feature special characteristics to ensure reliable feeding, printing, and application in automated environments.
