# LabTag Knowledge Base Overview

[🏠 Home](../index.md) > Overview

Welcome to the LabTag Knowledge Base. This section provides an introduction to the knowledge base structure and helps you navigate the resources effectively.

## About This Knowledge Base

The LabTag Knowledge Base is a comprehensive resource designed to help laboratory professionals find the right labeling solutions for their specific applications. It covers everything from product specifications to application guides and best practices.

## How to Use This Knowledge Base

### Navigation Structure

The knowledge base is organized into six main sections:

1. **Overview** (this section): Introduction and navigation guidance
2. **[Products](../Products/index.md)**: Detailed product information and specifications
3. **[Applications](../Applications/index.md)**: Solutions organized by laboratory application
4. **[Features](../Features/index.md)**: Technical features and capabilities 
5. **[Guides](../Guides/index.md)**: How-to instructions and best practices
6. **[Resources](../Resources/index.md)**: Tools, reference materials, and downloadable content

### Finding What You Need

There are several ways to find the information you need:

- **By Product**: If you know the product you're interested in, go to the [Products](../Products/index.md) section
- **By Application**: If you have a specific laboratory application, start in the [Applications](../Applications/index.md) section
- **By Feature**: If you're looking for products with specific capabilities, check the [Features](../Features/index.md) section
- **By Task**: If you need instructions for a specific task, visit the [Guides](../Guides/index.md) section
- **Using Tools**: For interactive tools and reference materials, browse the [Resources](../Resources/index.md) section

## Product Classification System

LabTag products use a structured naming convention that provides information about their capabilities:

```
CLASS-MODEL[VARIANT]C[PRINT_METHOD]-[SIZE][COLOR]
```

For example: `JTTA-7C1-1WH` indicates:
- `JTTA`: Cryo Barcode Labels product class
- `7`: Model number
- `C1`: Print method (Thermal Transfer, single across)
- `1`: Size (1 inch)
- `WH`: Color (White)

For a complete explanation of the SKU system, see the [SKU Decoder](../Resources/sku-decoder.md).
