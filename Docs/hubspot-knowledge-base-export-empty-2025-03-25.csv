"Knowledge Base","What is Direct Thermal?","Direct thermal printers use no ink, toner, or ribbon.","en","https://knowledge.labtag.com/knowledge/what-is-direct-thermal","<p>Direct thermal printing uses heat to selectively activate chemically treated, thermosensitive labels. The printer’s heated print-head comes in direct contact with the label, that has been coated with a material (a leuco dye) specially formulated to change color when exposed to heat. Once heated, the thermosensitive label reacts and darkens, creating the desired print.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As such, direct thermal printers use no ink, toner, or ribbon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>**Important Note**<br></strong>One important consideration when choosing this method is that the print is unstable and prone to fading over time, especially when stored in hot or humid conditions. Scratches can also produce enough heat to create marks on the label and affect the quality of the print.</p>","Printers","","","2019-09-18T16:58:23.246Z","PUBLISHED","false"
"Knowledge Base","Autoclave Labels","Autoclave labels are thermoplastic labels that resist the extreme heat and pressure of autoclaving, intended for materials that will undergo the sterilization process.","en","https://knowledge.labtag.com/knowledge/autoclave-labels","<p>These autoclave-resistant labels are ideal for labeling metal, glass, and plastic surfaces, and will withstand sterilization in steam autoclaves, dry heat ovens, gamma irradiators, and ethylene oxide gas chambers.</p>
<p>They have a working temperature range of -60°C/-76°F to +150°C/+302°F, resisting up to 30 psi of pressure as well as radiation levels as high as 50 KGy.</p>

<ul>
<li>Once your template is open in Word, click on “page layout” or the “layout” tab</li>
<li>Click the “margins” button</li>
<li>At the bottom of the drop-down window, select “custom margins”</li>
<li>In the new “page setup” window (under the “margins” tab), make sure the correct margins (Top and sides) are entered as indicated on our GA International labels for laser printers formatting appendix, Here.</li>
<li>If Word shows a warning pop-up indicating that some margins might be outside of the printable area of the page, click ignore</li>
<li>Please keep in mind that the number of the template is equivalent to the product SKU# (e.g. #23 is the corresponding template for CL, RCL and TRCL-23).</li>

"Knowledge Base","How to Calibrate Your Printer","Printer calibration is a simple but important process that ensures your printed labels line-up correctly on the paper, reducing waste and lost time. ","en","https://knowledge.labtag.com/knowledge/calibrate-your-printer","<p><strong>Here’s how to calibrate the different printer models we currently provide.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cab</strong></p>
<p>Calibrate the printer by pressing and holding the button located on the back right of the printer until the LED lights flash red; then release the button and the printer will now calibrate.</p>
<p>After going through the calibration process, you can press the feed button to make sure it is correctly calibrated as the printer should feed only one label at a time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zebra</strong></p>
<p>With the printer powered up, hold down the feed button until you get a two-flash sequence (the light will flash once, the twice) from the status light, then release the feed button.</p>
<p>You can then press the feed button to ensure only one label at a time comes out, indicating the printer is correctly calibrated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cognitive</strong></p>
<p>In the administrator’s label positioning tab, under “index settings”, select the appropriate indexing method for your labels. Click apply, save, and then calibrate to perform the calibration. You should receive a “successful” status message.</p>
<p>If calibration was successful, pressing the Feed button will eject only one label at a time.</p>","Printers","","","2019-09-18T16:58:21.394Z","PUBLISHED","false"

"Knowledge Base","Printing Labels in Color","For printing color labels, especially when multiple colors are required, inkjet printers offer the most complete solution.","en","https://knowledge.labtag.com/knowledge/printing-labels-in-color","<p>This is primarily due to the image quality provided. By allowing extremely precise placing of ink dots, these printers can more accurately reproduce an image, with very bright and vivid colors. This produces high-quality images and graphics.</p>
<p>Inkjet printers are also the only printers that can support either sheets or rolls.</p>
<p>Desktop inkjet printers, like those sold by HP, print labels in sheet format, while inkjet roll printers, such as those offered by Primera, can print labels in roll format. Both printer types provide similar quality results, though rolls printers can help reduce costs, by allowing for on-demand printing and the ability to load individual ink cartridges.</p>","Printers","","","2019-09-18T16:58:22.364Z","PUBLISHED","false"

"Knowledge Base","Finding the Right CryoSTUCK Labels for your Tubes","Careful consideration must be given when choosing the right CryoSTUCK® label for your cryogenic storage tubes. ","en","https://knowledge.labtag.com/knowledge/finding-the-right-cryostuck-labels-for-your-tubes","<p>There are 2 main criteria that must be addressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, the CryoSTUCK label must be chosen so as to create an area of overlap when the label is wrapped onto the frozen tube of at least 0.25”. This ensures the best possible adhesion when the label is applied onto frozen vials.</li>
<li>Secondly, a label must be chosen so that the printable portion (the portion of the label which excludes the clear wrap-around portion) is small enough as to not overlap with the rest of the label when applied onto the tube.</li>

"Knowledge Base","LIMS","","en","https://knowledge.labtag.com/knowledge/lims","<p>What exactly constitutes a laboratory management system is continually evolving, with new features and functionality added regularly; however, the base set of functions that define the LIMS software include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reception and logging of a sample with its associated data</li>
<li>Assignment, tracking, and scheduling of the sample’s analytical workload</li>
<li>Quality control associated with the sample and any utilized equipment and inventory</li>
<li>Storage of data acquired from any performed analyses</li>
<li>Compilation, inspection, and approval of data for reporting and further analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barcode labels are an indispensable part of a functional LIMS system. Without the use of barcodes, it would be impossible to properly track samples or to automate analytical workflows, as you would need to manually enter information at every step of the analysis. However, barcode labels serve a purpose beyond their ability to label your samples with scannable barcodes.</p>
<p>In addition to the use of barcodes, you should also consider factors that might affect the quality of your labels, including loss of adhesion, smudging, or fading, all of which can result in the loss of information associated with the sample. As such, it is critical that you use the appropriate labels for your application. Luckily, a wide range of specialty labels exists that can match any laboratory storage and/or usage condition, making it possible to achieve a 100% accurate sample identification and associated data traceability.</p>
<p>Regardless of your lab’s specific needs, there is a smart labeling solution available to meet your demanding standards. Ideal for all SOPs in biomedical and clinical research, from blood work and molecular biology to diagnostics and the identification of medication in clinical trials. They can also be made compatible with various printing methods commonly used in all laboratories and research facilities, such as thermal transfer, direct thermal, laser, and inkjet, or even automated print-and-apply systems.</p>","Software","","","2019-09-18T16:58:20.684Z","PUBLISHED","false"

<ul>
<li>The ribbon must be carefully matched with the material of the label being printed. For example, NitroTAG™ labels must be printed with RR class ribbons in order to ensure printout quality and optimal performance under cryogenic conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Ribbons are available in either 0.5"" or 1"" diameter cores, which are the cardboard cylinders that hold the ribbon. It is best to consult the user manual of your thermal printer to ensure the right core diameter is used.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a ribbon that is within the maximum width parameter of your printer (see your printer’s user manual), but still covers the entire width of your label to ensure that the printout encompasses the complete printable area of your label. It is fine to use a ribbon that is wider than your label width, though this can result in excessive ribbon waste. However, this may be advantageous in certain circumstances when different labels sizes are printed, as this will avoid unwanted swapping of ribbons.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Lastly, certain ribbon types are available in various lengths. Though, these varied ribbon lengths may be supplied on rolls that are too thick to fit into some of the smaller desktop thermal printers. Again, check your printer's user manual for the right size recommendation.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily at LABTAG, we have made your choice easier by offering quick and easy recommendations once you have chosen your desired label on our website. From there, use the handy filtering options to choose your ribbon according to your thermal printer type.</p>
<p>Our ribbon recommendations are the result of extensive research and development with careful consideration given to the performance of the label and ribbon as a whole.</p>","Ribbons","","","2019-09-18T16:58:19.998Z","PUBLISHED","false"

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Preserving the integrity of biological samples is vital, especially when labeling multiple vials. You don’t want to open and close your tank or freezer too many times or let your samples thaw on the bench. We recommend you do your labeling in batches and always set your samples in an insulated container of dry ice to preserve the temperature at -80°C. This is recommended as CryoSTUCK labels are meant to be applied at a minimum temperature of -80°C. So, if labeling vials stored in liquid nitrogen, dry ice will allow you to work comfortably and ensure the temperature of the samples does not rise to the point of thawing. Allow your tubes to equilibrate on dry ice for at least 5 minutes before labeling.</p>
<a id=""TT"" data-hs-anchor=""true""></a>
<h3>How to Apply Thermal-Transfer CryoSTUCK Labels</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our roll format CryoSTUCK® labels require an overlap of at least 0.25” to produce a secure adhesion to frozen vials and tubes. Ensure that your labels and vials allow for such overlap to guarantee the best adhesion and certify the cryo label will remain affixed on the frozen vials.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For optimal adhesion, wipe away any visibly accumulated frost with a clean lint-free disposable wipe (e.g: KimWipe™). Avoid excessive contact with the label adhesive during application. Apply the edge of the label first and press firmly to anchor it. If you have a wrap-around CryoSTUCK, apply the printable area first. Then press the label securely into position along the vials’ entire circumference. The vials can be stored in liquid nitrogen (-196°C), or ultra-low temperature freezers (-80°C) immediately following label application, requiring no cure time.</p>
<a id=""Laser"" data-hs-anchor=""true""></a>
<h3>How to Apply Laser CryoSTUCK Labels</h3>

"Knowledge Base","What is the Difference between Thermal-Transfer and Direct Thermal Printing","While both methods employ a heated printer head, thermal-transfer printers require an ink ribbon, while direct thermal printers do not need any ink sources for printing.","en","https://knowledge.labtag.com/en/knowledge/what-is-the-difference-between-thermal-transfer-and-direct-thermal-printing","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Direct-thermal and thermal-transfer printing share many similarities. Both techniques use a heated print head to print on the blank label. The main difference between the two techniques is the use of a printing ribbon in thermal-transfer printing, which is not required with direct-thermal methods.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Direct thermal printing uses heat to activate thermosensitive paper labels. The heated print head comes in direct contact with the label. When heated, the thermosensitive label reacts and darkens, creating the desired print. One important consideration when choosing this method is that this print is unstable and prone to fading over time, especially when stored in hot or humid conditions. Scratches can also produce enough heat to create marks on the label and affect the quality of the print.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In contrast to direct thermal printing, thermal-transfer methods use a ribbon to print information on labels. The heated print head is used to melt the ink coating of the ribbon, transferring it to the label. Since the label itself is not reactive, the print produced by this method is much more stable and a lot more durable. Thermal-transfer labels are usually made from a thermoplastic film, but can be made of paper material as well.</p>","Labels","Thermal-Transfer Labels","","2021-07-21T19:02:49.750Z","PUBLISHED","false"
