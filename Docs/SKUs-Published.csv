\n</ul>
\nHisto-PinTAG™ labels represent an innovation in identifying and processing diagnostic microscope slides that require new or supplementary information. Typical microscope slides are processed with labels containing information related to the histology/cytology sample with the originating patient information. However, slides are often sent to consulting facilities that must re-process the information to ensure compatibility with digital scanners and databases. Histo-PinTAG labels are specially designed to cover existing 2D barcodes while, at the same time, adding new information that allows the proper recording of data via a new unique barcode.
\n
\nAfter Histo-PinTAG has been printed using any standard thermal-transfer printer, the circle portion of the Histo-PinTAG label is affixed over the existing barcode, and the rectangular portion of the label, containing a new barcode, is then snapped-off and affixed just below the original label. The resulting re-labeled slide is now ready for processing, with new information and without interference from the original barcode, ensuring full compatibility with digital slide scanners.
\n
\nMoreover, the adhesive is specially formulated to allow the Histo-PinTAG label to be easily removed when the original label information needs to be accessed without damaging the original label or leaving behind any adhesive residue.
\n
\nHisto-PinTAG is an easy, one-step solution to re-identify microscope slides and eliminates the need for hard-to-manipulate dot labels or messy cover-up inks. In addition, its vibrant yellow color visually indicates that the microscope slides have been re-identified.
\n
\n<strong>*</strong>Thorough testing in end-user application conditions is highly recommended."

\nCryoSTUCK® cover-up labels are designed to be applied on both frozen and ambient temperature existing labels/surfaces in order to conceal their information. These cryogenic labels are ideal for re-labeling frozen cryo vials and microtubes as well as freezer boxes without the need for thawing, cure time, or any other special treatment*. They maintain excellent long-term adhesion for prolonged storage in liquid nitrogen tanks (-196°C/-321°F), ultra-low temperature freezers (-80°C/-112°F), and dry ice transportation. These blackout CryoSTUCK labels will completely obscure the existing information or even part of the information, such as barcodes or text.
\n
\nOur permanent cryo blackout labels will also resist elevated temperatures up to +121°C/+249°F and are perfectly suitable for identifying containers destined for standard steam autoclave cycles (+121°C/+250°F, 16.5 psi, 20 minutes) as well as oven dry heat. CryoSTUCK block-out labels are printable with most common thermal-transfer printers, and the best printout resistance will be generated using our XAR-class of solvent-resistant ink ribbons.

\nWhen using the recommended XAR ribbon, the printout of these cover-up labels is resistant to various chemicals, including ethanol, isopropanol, acetone and xylene, as well as to wiping and rubbing with alcohol sanitizing wipes.

\nCryoSTUCK® cover-up labels are designed to be applied on both frozen and ambient temperature existing labels/surfaces in order to conceal their information. These cryogenic labels are ideal for re-labeling frozen cryo vials and microtubes as well as freezer boxes without the need for thawing, cure time, or any other special treatment*. They maintain excellent long-term adhesion for prolonged storage in liquid nitrogen tanks (-196°C/-321°F), ultra-low temperature freezers (-80°C/-112°F), and dry ice transportation. These blackout CryoSTUCK labels will completely obscure the existing information or even part of the information, such as barcodes or text.
\n
\nOur permanent cryo blackout labels will also resist elevated temperatures up to +121°C/+249°F and are perfectly suitable for identifying containers destined for standard steam autoclave cycles (+121°C/+250°F, 16.5 psi, 20 minutes) as well as oven dry heat. CryoSTUCK block-out labels are printable with most common thermal-transfer printers, and the best printout resistance will be generated using our XAR-class of solvent-resistant ink ribbons.
\n
\nWhen using the recommended XAR ribbon, the printout of these cover-up labels is resistant to various chemicals, including ethanol, isopropanol, acetone and xylene, as well as to wiping and rubbing with alcohol sanitizing wipes.

\n  <li>Encode identical, or custom information onto replicate 2D barcoded tubes without the need for pre-engraved vials</li>
\n</ul>
\nPinTAG™️ cryogenic laser labels have a unique, patent-pending design that allows them to be affixed onto the side and bottom of 1.0 ml, 1.4 ml, and 2.0 ml slim-profile, high-throughput/automated sample storage tubes such as Matrix™️, Simport®️ T100-20, LVL technologies LI, and LX 1000, and others. They are designed to withstand ultra-low temperature conditions, down to -196°C (-321°F), making them suitable for long-term cryogenic and deep-freeze storage.
\n
\nThey can be affixed onto 2D barcoded tubes that do not have an inherent barcode or where the pre-established information needs to be updated and will fit nicely in their latch racks (48 and 96-well). This is an advantageous option where specific, user-defined barcodes (with human-readable information) must be used to identify individual tubes. They are fully compatible with all sample storage tube readers, scanners, tracking software, and automated/robotic liquid handling systems. These labels allow the user to define and encode their own information, replace damaged or unreadable barcodes, and overwrite or redefine inherent barcodes, thus affording maximum flexibility in high throughput applications that demand (re)labeling, such as clinical trials, diagnostics, and biobanking.
\n
\nPinTAG laser labels are provided in sheet format, printable with most common desktop laser printers. These tear-proof PinTAG labels do not jam printers and are resistant to UV and gamma irradiation (tested up to 50 KGy).

The primary quality of these high heat labels is their ability to remain readable after exposure to hot conditions, in contrast with standard direct thermal labels that turn entirely dark during the heating process. These permanent labels are suitable for identifying various laboratory labware and equipment composed of different materials, including metal, glass, and plastic. Given that these labels are also resistant to low temperatures (-80°C/ -112°F), they can be utilized for freezing applications and storage.
\n
\n*Please note that some minor label darkening/mottling may occur after standard autoclave conditions, boiling water, or temperature exposure exceeding the recommended limit. Prior testing is recommended to determine the suitability of this product for each particular application. (Get free samples)"

\nPeel &amp; Reveal FrozenSTUCK™ labels provide a unique solution for labeling ambient and already frozen<strong>*</strong> (as low as -80°C/-112°F) vials and tubes, with no thawing, curing, or any other special treatment required to apply these labels onto glass and plastic tubes, thereby preserving the biological integrity of sensitive specimens and contents. These direct thermal printable labels allow the end-user to print supplemental or extended content onto vials where space is limited. The removeable adhesive allows the label to wrap onto itself with no harm to the printed information underneath once the label is peeled away. Labels maintain excellent long-term adhesion for all layers at -80°C, including lab freezer storage and dry ice transportation. They also withstand 37°C water bath thawing, with all layers remaining attached and legible throughout the thawing process.
\n
\nDue to their special adhesive and conformable design, these peel-off labels are suitable for vaccine vials, counter and injectable medicines, medication bottles, cosmetics, clinical trials, and wherever extra label space is required to print extended content. Compatible with most common direct thermal and thermal transfer printers, these labels can be printed along the full length with alphanumeric text, barcodes, allergen warnings, nutritional facts, multiple languages, lot information, expiry dates, instructions for use, dosing, regulatory requirements, and other supplemental information. The printout of these labels is resistant to spraying and wiping with alcohol or sanitizing wipes.
\n
\n<strong>*</strong> To ensure proper adhesion, please remove excess frost prior to affixing and resealing the label.
\n
\n&nbsp;
\n
\n<strong>Benefits:</strong>
\n<ul>
\n 	<li>Ideal for ambient and frozen labeling and packaging without thawing</li>

\nCryoSTUCK® labels with SnapPEEL™ technology are an innovative new solution perfect for identifying already frozen vials (as low as -80°C/-112°F). The unique connected circle-and-rectangle design allows the cap and side of the tubes to be labeled seamlessly and effortlessly. Typical circle and rectangle labels require a separate, two-step action to affix the labels, with the dot labels often being difficult to peel and apply accurately. Our patent pending SnapPEEL technology allows the circle to be precisely affixed on a flat vial cap; the rectangle portion can then be easily snapped off and applied on the side of the tube. This significantly increases labeling efficiency and reduces excessive manipulation and unnecessary contact with the adhesive.

\nFreezerTAG™ labels with SnapPEEL™ technology represent an innovative and ergonomic development in identifying high-profile PCR tubes. The unique adjoined circle-and-rectangle design allows the cap and side of the tubes to be labeled seamlessly and effortlessly. Typical circle and rectangle labels require a separate, two-step action to affix the labels, with the dot labels often being difficult to peel and apply accurately. FreezerTAG labels with SnapPEEL technology allow the circle to be precisely affixed on the small PCR tube cap; the rectangle portion can then be easily snapped off and applied on the side of the tube. This significantly increases labeling efficiency and reduces excessive manipulation and unnecessary contact with the adhesive.
\n
\nOur FreezerTAG series of thermal-transfer deep-freeze labels have a strong permanent adhesive that will remain firmly and permanently attached in ultra-low temperatures. Designed for long-term preservation in laboratory freezers (-80°C/-112°F) and dry ice transportation. Additionally, these labels are waterproof, tearproof, and durable, they will adhere to wet surfaces and can withstand elevated temperatures up to +110°C (+230°F), making them safe for use in PCR thermal cyclers.
\n
\nThey are also resistant to spraying with ethanol, isopropanol, and other alcohols, as well as bleach and detergents (testing recommended), in addition to routine wiping and rubbing with surface sanitizing wipes.
\n
\nFreezerTAG labels can be printed with all major brands of thermal-transfer printers. They are available in a range of colors and sizes and can be printed with alphanumeric text, as well as 1D and 2D barcodes.

\nXyliTUFF™ labels are xylene and chemical ultra-resistant labels designed for a variety of applications and have long-term resistance to common organic solvents, industrial thinners, flux, oils, grease, degreasers, gasoline, as well as other chemicals and solvents.
\nCoated with a permanent chemical ultra-resistant adhesive, the labels retain their adhesion, even in the harshest environments. Intended for use on flat surfaces, these solvent-resistant labels, along with their printout, can withstand immersion in xylene for up to 15 hours on a microscope slide (thorough testing in end-user application conditions is highly recommended). Resistant as well to long-term exposure and immersion in safer clearing and deparaffinizing Xylene substitutes such as EZ Prep, Clearify™, Histo-Clear™, Formula 83™, Pro-Par, and others.
\nXyliTUFF labels are also resistant to standard gas sterilization with ethylene oxide (759 mg/L for 1 hour, at 55°C and 40-80% relative humidity). In addition, they resist continuous wiping and rubbing with surface sanitizing wipes such as Sani-Wipe™, Eco-Wipe™, and Eco-Wipe™ Duo.
\nCompatible with all major commercially available thermal-transfer barcode printers, these chemical-resistant histology, and industry-grade labels can be printed with alphanumeric text, 1D and 2D barcodes, and serialized numbers using our recommended XAR-class of chemical-resistant ribbons."

\nThese writable cryo labels are offered in a convenient dispenser box and feature our new SnapPEEL™ technology, an innovative and ergonomic advance in identifying cryo vials. Their unique CirTANGO™ shape, consisting of connected circle-and-rectangle labels, allows the cap and side of vials to be efficiently labeled seamlessly and effortlessly. Typical circle and rectangle labels require a separate, two-step action to affix the labels, with the dot labels often being difficult to peel and apply accurately. Labels with SnapPEEL technology allow the circle to be precisely affixed on the vial cap; the rectangle portion can then be easily snapped off and applied on the side of the vial. This significantly increases labeling efficiency and reduces excessive manipulation and unnecessary contact with the adhesive.
\n
\nNitroTAG cryogenic labels have a strong permanent adhesive that will remain firmly and permanently attached in ultra-low temperatures. They are designed for long-term cryo-preservation under cryogenic laboratory conditions, including in liquid and vapor phase liquid nitrogen (-196°C/-321°F), laboratory freezers (-80°C/-112°F), and dry ice transportation. These cryo vial labels require zero cure time and can be immersed in liquid nitrogen immediately after application without the need for additional tape or lamination. Additionally, these labels are waterproof, weatherproof, and durable, and will adhere to wet surfaces, resist multiple freeze-thaw cycles, and can withstand elevated temperatures up to +110°C.
\n
\nThey are also resistant to spraying with ethanol, isopropanol, and other alcohols, bleach, and detergents (testing recommended), as well as routine wiping and rubbing with surface sanitizing wipes such as Sani- Wipe™, Eco-Wipe™, and Eco-Wipe™ Duo. We recommend using our cryogenic SM-1 marker for writing on these labels, given that its ink is water-resistant and alcohol-resistant.
\n
\nNow available in a user-friendly dispenser box for improved convenience, this portable label dispenser ensures your labels are always accessible."

\n 	<li>Compatible with automated high-throughput sample storage and handling systems</li>
\n 	<li>Allows slim profile tubes to be re-labeled easily with barcodes and human-readable information</li>
\n 	<li>Encode identical or custom information onto replicate Matrix tubes without the need for pre-engraved vials</li>
\n</ul>
\nPinTAG™️ cryogenic labels have a unique, patent-pending, design that allows them to be affixed onto the side and bottom of slim profile, 1.0 ml, 1.4 ml, and 2.0 ml high-throughput/automated sample storage tubes such as Matrix™️, Simport®️ T100-20, LVL technologies LI, and LX 1000, and others. They are designed to withstand ultra-low temperature conditions, down to –196°C (-321°F), making them suitable for cryogenic and laboratory freezer storage, as well as transportation on dry ice.
\n
\nThese cryo labels can be affixed onto Matrix tubes that do not have an inherent barcode or where the pre-established information needs to be updated and will fit nicely in their latch racks (48 and 96-well arrays). This is an advantageous option where specific, user-defined barcodes (with human-readable information) need to be used to identify individual tubes. They are fully compatible with all sample storage tube readers, scanners, and tracking software, as well as automated/robotic liquid handling systems. These labels provide the user with an economical alternative to pre-barcoded vials, allowing them to define and encode their own information, replace damaged or unreadable barcodes, and overwrite or redefine inherent barcodes. These labels for slim profile tubes afford maximum flexibility in high-throughput applications that demand (re)labeling, such as clinical trials, diagnostics, biobanking, epidemiological studies, and kit manufacturing.
\n
\nPinTAG labels are thermal-transfer printable with most common thermal-transfer printers. Using barcoding software, the user can easily encode, print (1D/linear, 2D barcodes), and then affix the labels onto the tubes for maximum flexibility and control of information.

\nThese cryogenic labels are designed to be applied directly, and will rapidly adhere, to frozen cryo vials, tubes, cryo boxes, as well as plastic and cardboard freezer boxes, which are difficult to label under deep-freeze conditions (as low as -80°C/-112°F). Designed for long-term preservation in liquid nitrogen (-196°C/-321°F), -80°C (-112°F) freezers, for dry ice transportation, and can withstand temperatures up to +100°C (212°F)*.
\nPrintable with all common brands of laser printers to obtain a sharp, smudge-proof printout that is also resistant to mild laboratory chemicals (spray and swab). They can be applied on frozen vials and tubes without the need of an overlap and can also be written on with our Cryo-Markers.
\n*These labels have been tested to withstand up to 2 hours of 150°C/302°F dry heat. Some softening of the adhesive is observed, which is restored when the label is returned to ambient conditions."

\n&nbsp;
\n<ul>
\n 	<li>Easy and accurate label application</li>
\n 	<li>Increased speed and efficiency of repetitive vial labeling</li>
\n 	<li>Ideal for identifying temperature sensitive samples, no thawing of container or cure time required</li>
\n 	<li>Ideal for printing high-quality serialized data and barcodes</li>
\n</ul>
\nCryoSTUCK® labels with SnapPEEL™ technology represent an innovative and ergonomic development in identifying already frozen vials (as low as -80°C/-112°F). The unique connected circle-and-rectangle design allows the cap and side of the tubes to be labeled seamlessly and effortlessly. Typical circle and rectangle labels require a separate, two-step action to affix the labels, with the dot labels often being difficult to peel and apply accurately. Our patent pending SnapPEEL technology allows the circle to be precisely affixed on a flat vial cap; the rectangle portion can then be easily snapped off and applied on the side of the tube. This significantly increases labeling efficiency and reduces excessive manipulation and unnecessary contact with the adhesive.
\n
\nOur CryoSTUCK series of laser printable labels have a strong permanent adhesive that will remain firmly and permanently attached in ultra-low temperatures.<strong>*</strong> Designed for long-term preservation in liquid nitrogen (-196°C/-321°F), -80°C (-112°F) freezers, and dry ice transportation. Additionally, these labels are waterproof, durable, and will remain adhered to vials in heated water baths.<strong>*</strong>
\n
\nPrintable with most common brands of laser printers<strong>*</strong> to obtain a sharp, smudge-proof printout that is also resistant to mild laboratory chemicals (spray and swab). They can be applied on frozen vials and tubes without an overlap and can be written on with our Cryo-Markers. Free MS Word templates are available for quick set-up.
\n
\n<strong>*</strong>Please request a sample to test full compatibility with certain laser printer models and vial types. Partial flagging of the label may occur under extended water bath conditions."

\nCombining RFID technology and our thermal-transfer printable cryogenic labels into one product, RFID NitroTAG® labels are the first cryogenic RFID labels that can be used in liquid nitrogen. They can be printed and encoded using dedicated RFID thermal-transfer printers. Their flexible, passive UHF RFID chip (Class 1, Gen 2) can be encoded with up to 32 hexadecimal characters of information to record data during sample processing. The resulting label can thus contain both visual and electronic data for maximum sample tracking flexibility.
\n
\nRFID NitroTAG labels are specifically designed for short and long-term storage under ultra-low temperatures and cryogenic environments, including liquid and vapor phase liquid nitrogen (-196ºC/-321°F), lab freezers (-80°C/-112°F), and dry ice transportation. They have a strong permanent adhesive to ensure they will stay affixed on cryo tubes &amp; vials<strong>*</strong>, cardboard and polypropylene cryo/freezer boxes, plastic bags, and triangular cassettes for straw storage. They can be scanned/read without the need for direct line-of-sight, even when in liquid nitrogen<strong>**</strong> or immersed up to 1.5”/38 mm<strong>***</strong> in a 37°C water bath. This can help eliminate unwanted freeze-thaw cycles, thus preserving the samples’ integrity. They are ideal for biobanks, biorepositories, fertility clinics, and crystallography laboratories.
\n
\nThese RFID labels are compatible with handheld, fixed, integrated, and cryogenic (Dewar neck) RFID readers. Moreover, they can be integrated with electronic witnessing systems to improve the identification and traceability of samples, as well as workflow efficiency to comply with audits. The printout obtained is also resistant to alcohol spraying/swabbing and sanitizing wipes when printed with our recommended smudge-proof RR-class of resin ribbons.

\n<ul>
\n 	<li>Autoclave indicator strip will allow you to quickly and easily identify if the material has in fact, been autoclaved, without the need to use additional autoclave sterilization tape</li>
\n 	<li>Printable with all common brands of thermal-transfer printers</li>
\n 	<li>Can resist high temperatures and saturated steam, ideal for autoclave sterilization cycles at 121°C (250°F) and 16.5 psi pressure</li>
\n</ul>
\nCombining two unique features, these permanent autoclave-resistant labels are thermal-transfer printable with sharp, smudge-proof serialized text and barcodes, and have an indicator strip that noticeably changes color (from white to charcoal gray) when the labels have been autoclaved.
