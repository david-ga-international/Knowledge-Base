## The Challenge: Labeling Already-Frozen Samples

One of the most challenging situations in laboratory sample management is the need to label containers that are already frozen. Traditional labels require thawing samples before application, which can compromise sample integrity and is often impossible for irreplaceable specimens.

LabTag offers specialized solutions that allow you to label containers that are already at -80°C without thawing, preserving sample integrity while providing reliable identification.

## Common Frozen Sample Labeling Issues

- **Sample Integrity**: Thawing compromises sensitive biological samples
- **Adhesion Failure**: Standard adhesives won't bond to frozen surfaces
- **Frost Formation**: Condensation interferes with label application
- **Irreplaceable Specimens**: Cannot risk thawing valuable historical samples
- **Legacy Collections**: Need to standardize identification on older samples
- **Biobank Reorganization**: Restructuring storage without compromising samples

## Application Process

Proper application technique is critical for successful frozen surface labeling:

1. **Print Preparation**: Print labels before application using thermal transfer technology with resin ribbons
2. **Tool Preparation**: Precool application tools to prevent localized warming
3. **Quick Application**: Apply labels with firm pressure using gloved hands
4. **Verification**: Confirm adhesion before returning to storage
5. **Documentation**: Update inventory records with new label information

## Compatible Printing Technologies

For maximum durability in cryogenic conditions, we recommend:

- **Thermal Transfer Printing**: Our recommended method for frozen vial labels
- **Recommended Printers**: GA-300, Zebra ZD620, or other thermal transfer printers
- **Ribbon Selection**: High-quality resin ribbons (RTT) for maximum durability
- **Pre-Printed Options**: Available for standardized information

## Case Studies

### Legacy Biobank Reorganization

**Challenge**: A major university biobank needed to reorganize 50,000+ historical samples without thawing.

**Solution**: Implemented L2FS labels with custom software for inventory tracking.

**Result**: Successfully relabeled entire collection without removing samples from -80°C storage, preserving irreplaceable specimens while modernizing tracking system.

### Pharmaceutical Sample Management

**Challenge**: Thousands of frozen compounds needed standardized barcoding without temperature cycling.

**Solution**: Used L2FS labels with high-density 2D barcodes and wireless scanning system.

**Result**: 100% successful application rate, zero compound degradation, complete inventory verification in 48 hours.
