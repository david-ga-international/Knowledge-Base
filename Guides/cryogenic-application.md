# Cryogenic Label Application Guide

[🏠 Home](../index.md) > [Guides](./index.md) > Cryogenic Application

## Introduction

This guide provides best practices for applying cryogenic labels to laboratory containers destined for extreme cold storage. Following these guidelines will ensure optimal adhesion, durability, and overall performance of your labels in cryogenic environments.

## General Best Practices

### Surface Preparation

1. **Clean thoroughly**: Ensure surfaces are free from dust, oils, and residues.
   - Use isopropyl alcohol (70-100%) for most surfaces
   - Allow to dry completely before application

2. **Temperature considerations**:
   - For standard application: Apply at room temperature (20-25°C)
   - For frozen surfaces: See the [CryoSTUCK® Application Guide](./cryostuck-application.md)

3. **Moisture control**:
   - Ensure surfaces are completely dry
   - Avoid condensation on cold containers brought to room temperature

### Application Technique

1. **Firm pressure**: Apply firm, even pressure across the entire label
   - Use a label applicator tool for consistent results
   - For small vials, roll the vial across a flat surface while applying the label

2. **Avoid air bubbles**:
   - Apply from one edge and smooth toward the opposite edge
   - Use a soft cloth or rubber roller to remove any trapped air

3. **Handling time**:
   - Allow 24 hours for adhesive to fully cure before freezing (when possible)
   - Minimize handling during this period

## Container-Specific Application Guidelines

### Cryogenic Vials (1.0-5.0ml)

<div class="application-instructions">
<h4>Standard Method</h4>
<ol>
<li>Clean the vial surface with isopropyl alcohol and allow to dry completely</li>
<li>Peel the label from the liner, holding by the edges to avoid touching the adhesive</li>
<li>Position the label slightly above the intended location</li>
<li>Apply the top edge first, then smoothly roll the label around the vial</li>
<li>For wrap-around labels, ensure the clear tail overlaps the printed portion by at least 3mm</li>
<li>Apply firm pressure across the entire label, focusing on the edges</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="application-tip">
<h4>Pro Tip</h4>
<p>For optimal barcode scanning, align the barcode parallel to the length of the vial (ladder orientation). This improves readability, especially on small-diameter containers.</p>
</div>

### Microtubes (0.5-2.0ml)

<div class="application-instructions">
<h4>Standard Method</h4>
<ol>
<li>Clean the tube surface with isopropyl alcohol and allow to dry completely</li>
<li>For tubes with textured writing surfaces, apply labels to the smooth side</li>
<li>Use miniature format labels designed specifically for microtubes</li>
<li>Apply labels in a straight line, avoiding wrinkles from tube curvature</li>
<li>For round-bottom tubes, place the label slightly higher to avoid the curved bottom</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="application-tip">
<h4>Pro Tip</h4>
<p>For tubes with very small diameters, our SnapPEEL™ technology makes application easier by providing a tab to hold while placing the small dot label. The rectangle portion can then be applied to the tube side.</p>
</div>

### Microplates and Cell Culture Plates

<div class="application-instructions">
<h4>Standard Method</h4>
<ol>
<li>Clean the designated area on the plate with isopropyl alcohol</li>
<li>Apply labels to flat surfaces, typically on the short or long side of the plate</li>
<li>Avoid placing over wells or areas that may interfere with equipment</li>
<li>Apply with firm, even pressure across the entire label</li>
<li>For plates that will be sealed or have condensation, apply labels to the sides rather than the top</li>
</ol>
</div>

### Metal Racks and Canisters

<div class="application-instructions">
<h4>Standard Method</h4>
<ol>
<li>Clean the metal surface thoroughly with isopropyl alcohol and allow to dry completely</li>
<li>Remove any oxidation or rust with a soft brush before cleaning</li>
<li>Use labels specifically designed for metal surfaces (AWA Series)</li>
<li>Apply with very firm pressure to ensure complete contact with the metal surface</li>
<li>Allow 24-48 hours for optimal adhesion before exposure to extreme cold</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="application-tip">
<h4>Pro Tip</h4>
<p>For heavily textured metal surfaces, use thicker label stock that can conform to the surface variations. Our AWA Series is specifically formulated with a more robust adhesive for metal surfaces in cryogenic environments.</p>
</div>

### IVF Straws

<div class="application-instructions">
<h4>Standard Method</h4>
<ol>
<li>Clean straws with isopropyl alcohol if necessary</li>
<li>Use specialized small-format labels designed specifically for IVF straws</li>
<li>Apply labels before filling straws</li>
<li>Ensure labels do not overlap the sealing areas</li>
<li>Use color-coding for quick visual identification</li>
</ol>
</div>

## Special Application Methods

### Applying to Frozen Surfaces

For applying labels to already-frozen containers at -80°C, use our CryoSTUCK® technology and refer to the [CryoSTUCK® Application Guide](./cryostuck-application.md) for specific instructions.

### Applying Wrap-Around Labels

<div class="application-instructions">
<h4>Standard Method</h4>
<ol>
<li>Clean the container surface with isopropyl alcohol</li>
<li>Peel the label from the liner</li>
<li>Position the printed portion on the container</li>
<li>Wrap the clear laminate portion around, ensuring it overlaps the printed portion</li>
<li>Apply firm pressure to the overlap area to create a secure bond</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="application-tip">
<h4>Pro Tip</h4>
<p>For small containers, wrap the label around so the barcode is fully visible on one side rather than wrapping around the curvature, which can distort barcode readability.</p>
</div>

## Printing Considerations

### Thermal Transfer Printing

- Use resin (RR-class) ribbons for maximum durability in cryogenic environments
- Print density settings: 25-30% higher than standard applications
- Print speed: Reduce by 25-50% for optimal print quality
- Regular printhead maintenance is essential for consistent results

### Laser Printing

- Use high-resolution settings (600 dpi minimum)
- Ensure toner is fully fused to the label material
- Allow prints to cool completely before handling or application

### Inkjet Printing

- Allow prints to dry completely (24+ hours) before exposure to extreme cold
- Use waterproof inkjet formulations when available
- Consider protective overlaminates for added durability

## Storage Recommendations

### Before Application

- Store unused labels in cool, dry conditions (20-25°C, 40-60% humidity)
- Keep in original packaging until ready to use
- Avoid exposure to direct sunlight or heat sources
- Typical shelf life is 2 years from production date

### After Application

- Allow 24 hours for adhesive to cure before freezing (when possible)
- Introduce to cold environments gradually when possible
- Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles when not necessary
- For long-term storage, maintain stable temperatures
