## General Guidelines

Preserving the integrity of biological samples is vital when labeling multiple vials. Follow these key best practices:

- **Use dry ice**: Set your samples in an insulated container of dry ice to maintain them at approximately -80°C during the labeling process
- **Work in batches**: Label multiple samples at once to minimize the number of times you open and close your freezer or storage tank
- **Temperature equilibration**: Allow your tubes to equilibrate on dry ice for at least 5 minutes before labeling
- **Frost removal**: Wipe away any visible frost with a clean lint-free disposable wipe (e.g., KimWipe™)
- **Minimize adhesive contact**: Avoid excessive contact with the label adhesive during application
- **Immediate storage**: Vials can be returned to liquid nitrogen (-196°C) or ultra-low temperature freezers (-80°C) immediately after labeling with no cure time required

## How to Apply Thermal-Transfer CryoSTUCK Labels

Our roll format CryoSTUCK® labels require an overlap of at least 0.25" to produce a secure adhesion to frozen vials and tubes.

1. **Prepare surface**: Wipe away any visibly accumulated frost with a clean lint-free disposable wipe
2. **Initial placement**: Apply the edge of the label first and press firmly to anchor it
3. **For wrap-around labels**: Apply the printable area first
4. **Complete application**: Press the label securely into position along the vial's entire circumference
5. **Storage**: The vials can be returned to storage immediately with no cure time required

## How to Apply Laser CryoSTUCK Labels

Our laser format CryoSTUCK® labels do not require an overlap to produce a secure adhesion to frozen vials and tubes.

1. **Prepare surface**: Wipe the surface of the vial/tube with a clean lint-free disposable wipe to remove excess frost
2. **Initial placement**: Apply the edge of the label first and press firmly to anchor it
3. **Complete application**: Press the label securely into position along the vial's entire circumference
4. **Storage**: The vials can be returned to storage immediately with no cure time required

## How to Apply DYMO-Compatible CryoSTUCK Labels

DYMO-compatible CryoSTUCK® labels do not require an overlap to produce a secure adhesion to frozen vials and tubes.

1. **Prepare surface**: Wipe the surface with a clean lint-free disposable wipe to remove any visibly accumulated frost
2. **Initial placement**: Apply the edge of the label first, pressing firmly to anchor it
3. **Complete application**: Apply the label securely into position along the vial's entire circumference
4. **Storage**: The cryo vials can be returned to storage immediately with no cure time required

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Label not adhering properly | Excessive frost on the surface | Wipe thoroughly with a lint-free wipe before application |
| Label corners lifting | Insufficient pressure during application | Press firmly on all edges, especially the corners |
| Label overlap not sticking | Overlap area too small | Ensure overlap is at least 0.25" for thermal-transfer labels |
| Printout smearing or fading | Incorrect ribbon used with thermal transfer | Use only recommended resin ribbon for cryogenic applications |
| Difficulty removing the label from the carrier | Cold fingers/gloves | Warm fingertips slightly before handling labels |

## Best Practices for Storage After Labeling

- Store labeled containers in an organized storage system for easy retrieval
- Consider color-coding or additional identification systems for visual organization
- Verify label adhesion periodically for long-term storage samples
- Keep a digital record or database matching label information to sample contents
