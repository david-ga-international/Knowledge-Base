## Importance of Printer Calibration

Printer calibration is a simple but important process that ensures your printed labels line up correctly on the paper, reducing waste and lost time. Proper calibration helps your printer correctly identify where each label starts and ends, especially for roll format labels.

## Calibration Instructions by Printer Model

### Cab Printers

1. Power on the printer and make sure it is loaded with labels
2. Locate the button on the back right of the printer
3. Press and hold the button until the LED lights flash red
4. Release the button and the printer will begin the calibration process
5. After calibration is complete, press the feed button to verify that the printer feeds exactly one label at a time

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If multiple labels feed at once, repeat the calibration process ensuring you hold the button until the red flash sequence occurs.</p>
</div>

### Zebra Printers

1. Power on the printer and ensure labels are properly loaded
2. Locate the feed button on the front of the printer
3. Press and hold the feed button until you see a specific flash sequence from the status light (one flash followed by two flashes)
4. Release the feed button
5. The printer will automatically feed several labels as part of the calibration process
6. Test the calibration by pressing the feed button - only one label should advance at a time

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For more advanced Zebra models with control panels, calibration may be accessible through the menu system under "Tools" or "Settings".</p>

### Cognitive Printers

1. Power on the printer and load labels
2. Access the administrator's settings in the printer software
3. Navigate to the label positioning tab
4. Under "index settings," select the appropriate indexing method for your labels
5. Click apply, then save
6. Click the calibrate button to perform the calibration
7. You should receive a "successful" status message when complete
8. Test by pressing the Feed button - only one label should eject at a time

## Common Calibration Issues

### Multiple Labels Feed at Once

**Possible causes:**
- Calibration was unsuccessful
- Sensor is dirty or obstructed
- Incorrect label type selected in printer settings
- Media guide not properly adjusted

**Solutions:**
- Repeat the calibration process
- Clean the label sensor with compressed air
- Ensure the correct media type is selected in printer settings
- Check that the media guide is properly adjusted for your label width

### No Label Movement or Continuous Feed

**Possible causes:**
- Sensor cannot detect label gaps or black marks
- Wrong sensor type selected (gap vs. black mark)
- Ribbon installed incorrectly (for thermal transfer printers)

**Solutions:**
- Ensure you're using the correct sensor type for your labels
- Check ribbon installation (if applicable)
- Manually adjust the sensor position to align with gaps or black marks

## When to Recalibrate

You should recalibrate your printer whenever:

- You change to a different size or type of label
- You observe inconsistent printing positions
- You replace any printer components
- Multiple labels feed at once
- You move the printer to a new location
- After regular maintenance
