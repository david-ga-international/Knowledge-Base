# Label Selection Guide

## Introduction
This guide will help you select the appropriate label for your specific application by considering key factors such as environment, surface type, and printing method.

## Key Selection Factors

### 1. Environmental Conditions
- Temperature range
- Humidity levels
- Chemical exposure
- UV exposure
- Sterilization requirements

### 2. Surface Type
- Glass
- Plastic
- Metal
- Paper
- Polypropylene
